<h1>Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Counter</h2>

<MatFAB icon="exposure_plus_1" @onclick="@IncrementCount"></MatFAB>

<p>
    Current Page Count: <strong>@currentCount</strong>
    <br />
    Current User Profile / Persistent Count: <strong>@if (@profileCurrentCount != -1)@profileCurrentCount</strong>
</p>

<p>
    There is a "User Profile" for persistant user data built into BlazorBoilerplate. This is a bit of hack until Microsoft or others create that functionality.
    Currently we store Sidebar Navigation settings, Count. In the future I would like to track the users last page but I don't see much for <br/>
</p>

@code {
    int currentCount = 0;
    int profileCurrentCount = -1;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        profileCurrentCount = await appState.GetUserProfileCount();
    }

    public async Task IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
        profileCurrentCount++;
        await appState.UpdateUserProfileCount(profileCurrentCount);
    }
}
