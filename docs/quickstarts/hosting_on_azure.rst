**Hosting Blazor Boilerplate 2.0.0 on Azure**
=============================================

(Note: This document builds upon, and credits, an earlier pdf guide
produced by @soomon).

This guide produces a working **demonstration** installation of Blazor
Boilerplate on Azure App Services using the Development branch. Various
configuration settings, security and design considerations **must be
evaluated** before moving into production.

This guide is tested/working as at **June 2021**.

Preamble 
~~~~~~~~

Please be aware that hosting on Microsoft Azure will cost money. This
tutorial assumes that you already have a working Azure subscription.

In this example, Blazor Boilerplate is being hosted using App Services
and a managed SQL database.

The certificate for Identity Server has been stored in Azure Key Vault.

Visual Studio is being used to deploy the app to Azure. Version 16.10.0
was used in this example.

Ensure that you choose the same subscription, region and resource group
for all resources created in this tutorial. Some Azure resources cannot
see each other across regions.

All URIs, resources, usernames and passwords shown have been deleted
prior to publishing.

Configure Azure Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the Azure Web App
------------------------

Using either the Azure Portal App
(https://portal.azure.com/App/Download?acceptLicense=true) or the portal
web interface, create a new Web App and configure it as follows:

.. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image1.png
   :width: 3.51389in
   :height: 4.39077in

**Resource Group:** (create new) blazor_boilerplate_demo_rg

**Instance Name:** blazor-boilerplate**(.azurewebsites.net)

**Publish:** Code

**Stack:** .NET 5

**OS:** Windows

**Region:** (whatever works for you)

**App Service Plan:** (create new) blazor-boilerplate-app-service-plan.
Select the Dev/Free F1 tier for demo purposes.

\*\* The instance name must be globally unique. It is created in the
azurewebsites.net domain.

Review + create the new web app, then open the resource to continue with
configuration.

Configure the Azure Web App
---------------------------

.. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image2.png
   :width: 7.26875in
   :height: 2.80417in

a. Select **Configuration** and **General Settings** and configure as
   follows:

..

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image3.png
      :width: 2.44444in
      :height: 4.17264in

   **Stack:** .NET

   **.NET Version:** .NET 5*\*

   **Platform:** 64 Bit

   **Pipeline:** Integrated

   **Web Sockets:** On

   **Remote Debugging:** On / VS 2019

\*\* Currently there is a bug in the portal that causes .NET version
   to display .NET Core (3.1/2.1) whenever you return to the general
   settings page. This is OK, it doesn't affect our demo.

   Save these general settings and exit configuration.

b. Select **Identity** and confirm that that **System Assigned** identity
   is turned **on**.

..

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image4.png
      :width: 1.66675in
      :height: 2.31956in

c. Configure **Custom Domains** and **TLS/SSL Settings**

..

   By default, the new web app is accessible via
   http://blazor-boilerplate.azurewebsites.net\ **.** To enable various
   security features in Blazor Boilerplate to function in a hosted
   environment it must be secured with an SSL certificate.

   Either:

-  secure the default URL (in the azurewebsites.net domain)

..

   Or:

-  create your own host in a custom domain you control (e.g.,
   http://blazor-boilerplate.demodomain.com)

..

   The SSL certificate you create must of course match the host and
   domain name of your web app.

   If you are using a custom domain, select **Custom Domains** and add and verify a new custom domain.
   Note: you will need access to DNS host records for your chosen domain
   to verify it using the custom domain verification ID. In this example
   we have added blazor-boilerplate.demodomain.com as a custom domain.

   Create a Private Key Certificate which will be used for TLS/SSL
   binding, using the hostname you have chosen, in this example
   blazor-boilerplate.demodomain.com. Create a self-signed certificate
   or a use a free service like letsencrypt.org.
   Make sure you mark the private key as exportable when you create the
   certificate.

   Select **TLS/SSL Settings** and upload the .pfx certificate, then
   under **Bindings** add a binding to your chosen host name.

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image5.png
      :width: 2.88194in
      :height: 2.77357in

d. Finally, select **Overview** and download the publish profile that
   you will later import into Visual Studio.

Create and Configure Azure SQL Server and SQL Database
------------------------------------------------------

   Create a new Azure SQL server called blazor-boilerplate-demo-sql in the blazor_boilerplate_demo_rg resource group (very
   simple to do so instructions not shown here). 

   Select **Show Firewall Settings** and ensure that **Allow Azure
   services and resources to access this server** is turned **on**.

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image6.png
      :width: 1.88194in
      :height: 1.87133in

   Select **+ Create Database** and configure the new database as
   follows:

   **Database Name:** blazor-boilerplate-demo-db

   **Elastic Pool:** No

   **Compute/Storage:** Basic 5DTU/2GB (about US$5 per month)

   Once created, open the new SQL database resource and select **Show
   database connection strings**. Copy the **ADO.NET (SQL Authentication)**
   string and save it for use in the next step.

Configure Visual Studio Project for Azure Publishing
----------------------------------------------------

   Open the Blazor Boilerplate solution in VS and select the
   BlazorBoilerplate.Server project. Right-click/Publish and select **+
   New** to create a new profile. Select **Import Profile** and now
   browse and select the Azure Web Deploy publish profile you downloaded
   from the Overview tab earlier.

   Edit the new profile and configure as follows:

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image7.png
      :width: 3in
      :height: 2.18293in

   **Release:** Any CPU

   **Framework:** .net5.0

   **Deployment Mode:** Self-Contained

   **Runtime:** win-x64

   **File Publish:** Remove additional files at destination

   **Databases/Default:** Use this connection string at runtime

   Now paste the SQL database connection string you saved earlier and
   make this modification. Change 'Server' to 'Data Source'. The final
   string should look something like this:

   Data
   Source=tcp:blazor-boilerplate-demo-sql.database.windows.net,1433;
   Initial Catalog=blazor-boilerplate-demo-db;User Id=<adminusername>;
   Password=<adminuserpassword>; Trusted_Connection=False; Encrypt=True;
   MultipleActiveResultSets=True;

   Paste the same connection string into each of the **Entity Framework
   Migrations**.

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image8.png
      :width: 1.56953in
      :height: 2.17372in

   Select the **Connection** tab and confirm that the **Destination
   URL** is http://blazor-boilerplate.azurewebsites.net or change it to
   your custom one (http://blazor-boilerplate.demodomain.com) if you are
   using a custom domain. This is the URL that the publish tool will
   open after publishing.

Create and Configure Azure Key Vault
------------------------------------

   This key vault will hold the .pfx certificate in the cloud so that
   BlazorBoilerplate can access it securely.

   Create a new Azure Key Vault in the blazor_boilerplate_demo_rg
   resource group and name it blazor-boilerplate-demo-vault.

   Open the new resource, select **Certificates** and choose **+
   Generate/Import**, then import your .pfx certificate.

   Give the certificate the name BBAUTH and password Admin123.

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image9.png
      :width: 2.65291in
      :height: 3.17377in

   Select the certificate in the list and check that **Issuance Policy /
   Advanced Policy Configuration** has **Exportable Private Key** set to
   Yes.

   Return to the key vault main menu and select **Access Policies**. Add
   a new policy, then click **Select Principal** and search for / select
   the Azure App Service you created earlier (e.g. blazor-boilerplate).

   Give the policy Get access to **Secret Permissions**, because
   Identity Server needs access to the private key so we will import the
   certificate as a secret.

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image10.png
      :width: 3.18139in
      :height: 3.4375in

   Copy the **DNS Name** of the key vault and save it so that you can
   add it to appsettings.json in a later step.

Create and Configure Blob Storage (for keys.xml)
------------------------------------------------

   In Startup.cs we persist keys to Azure Blob Storage and protect them
   with Azure Key Vault. We therefore need access to a private blob
   container to store the keys.

   Create an **Azure Storage Account** in the blazor_boilerplate_demo_rg
   resource group and name it blazorboilerplate_storage or similar.

   Open the new resource and select **+ Container** to create a new blob
   container called blazor-boilerplate-keys. The access level should be
   private.

   Return to the storage account and select **Access Keys**, then unhide
   the keys. Copy the key1 or key2 **Connection String** and save it so
   that you can add it to **appsettings.json** in the next step.

Configure Blazor Boilerplate & Deploy to Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure Azure settings in appsettings.json 
--------------------------------------------

   In Visual Studio, open the BlazorBoilerplate solution if it isn't
   already, then select the **BlazorBoilerplate.Server** project. Edit
   **appsettings.json**.

Set **DefaultConnection** to the string we stored earlier, e.g:

   Data
   Source=tcp:blazor-boilerplate-demo-sql.database.windows.net,1433;
   Initial Catalog=blazor-boilerplate-demo-db;User Id=<adminusername>;
   Password=<adminuserpassword>; Trusted_Connection=False; Encrypt=True;
   MultipleActiveResultSets=True;

Edit both of the following sections and insert your saved parameters where shown:

**"HostingOnAzure":** {

"RunsOnAzure": true,

"RunningAsAppService": true,

"RunningAsDocker": false, // not implemented yet.

"AzureKeyVault": {

"UsingKeyVault": true,

"UseManagedAppIdentity": true,

"AppKey": "", // not implemented yet.

"AppSecret": "",

"VaultURI": "https://blazor-boilerplate-demo.vault.azure.net/",

"CertificateIdentifier": "https://
blazor-boilerplate-demo.vault.azure.net/certificates/BBAUTH/??????",

"CertificateName": "BBAUTH",

   "StorageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;
   AccountName=blazorboilerplate_storage; AccountKey=???????????????????????????==;
   EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",

"ContainerName": "blazor-boilerplate-keys",

"KeyBlobName": "keys.xml"

}

},

**"BlazorBoilerplate"**: {

"ApplicationUrl": "https://blazor-boilerplate.demodomain.com",

"IS4ApplicationUrl": "https://blazor-boilerplate.demodomain.com",

"UseLocalCertStore": false,

"CertificateThumbprint": "???????????????????????????????????",

"RequireConfirmedEmail": false,

"API": {

"Logging": {

"Enabled": true,

"IgnorePaths": [ "/api/account", "/api/admin", "/api/apilog" ]

},

"Doc": {

"Enabled": true

}

},

"UsePostgresServer": false

},

   You may also want to change **Serilog / MinimumLevel / Default** from
   'Warning' to 'Debug' while you are getting the demo up and running.

Check / Modify Startup.cs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In Visual Studio, open the BlazorBoilerplate solution if it isn't
   already, then select the **BlazorBoilerplate.Server** project. Edit
   **Startup.cs**.

   The section that relates to Azure hosting begins around line 147.
   Edit the two lines below as shown:

   (Add a reference to **using Azure.Identity;**)

   **dataProtectionBuilder.PersistKeysToAzureBlobStorage**\ (Configuration["HostingOnAzure:AzureKeyVault:StorageConnectionString"],
   Configuration["HostingOnAzure:AzureKeyVault:ContainerName"],
   Configuration["HostingOnAzure:AzureKeyVault:KeyBlobName"]);

   **dataProtectionBuilder.ProtectKeysWithAzureKeyVault**\ (new
   Uri(Configuration["HostingOnAzure:AzureKeyVault:CertificateIdentifier"]),
   new DefaultAzureCredential());

   These lines will now read their configuration values from
   **appsettings.json**.

   There is a limitation of persisting keys to blob storage in the
   library we are currently using. The blob won't get created on first
   run, and will probably error. To fix this, comment out the
   **dataProtectionBuilder.ProtectKeysWithAzureKeyVault** for now, publish the app and let it run, and
   verify that **keys.xml** is created in the blob container before you
   uncomment it.

Publish the BlazorBoilerplate Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Right-Click the **BlazorBoilerplate.Server** project and select
   **Publish.** Hit the Publish button and check that the app publishes
   without errors and opens a browser with the URL you specified earlier
   in the publish profile.

   If the app was published successfully, you can now check that it
   managed to persist keys to blob storage. Open your **Storage
   Account** and select **Containers**. Open the blazor-boilerplate-keys
   container and confirm that keys.xml now exists. If so, proceed to the
   final step below.

   .. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image11.png
      :width: 2.75926in
      :height: 1.55556in

   The site should now
   redirect to https://blazor-boilerplate.demodomain.com or
   https://blazor-boilerplate.azurewebsites.net if you aren't using a
   custom domain, and open correctly at the Blazor Boilerplate home
   page.

Azure Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------------

Kudu
~~~~

The **Kudu Diagnostic Console** is available at
https://blazor-boilerplate.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole.

A few of the more useful troubleshooting logs are:

**/LogFiles/stdout_???_??.log**. This is where you can monitor various
EntityFrameworkCore database commands.

**/site/wwwroot/Logs/log-????.log.** If you set the **Serilog
MinimumLevel** to Debug earlier you will see the full series of startup
log entries, including any errors related to startup.

You can also stream logs from the web app either within the Azure Portal
(Web App Service / Monitoring / Log Stream) or to Visual Studio if you
prefer.

Remote Debug in Visual Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remotely debug, you must first publish a **Debug Configuration** of
Blazor Boilerplate to Azure.

As a simple remote debugging test, try the following:

Open **the Shared / Modules** folder and the
**BlazorBoilerplate.Theme.Material.Demo** project. Open the **Pages**
folder and edit **TodoList.razor.** Set a breakpoint at the line **await
LoadMainEntities();**

Open **Cloud Explorer** in Visual Studio and select your web app within your subscription (under App Services),
right-click and**Attach Debugger** to the Blazor
Boilerplate app as described above. The Visual Studio Output Window will
show the application starting up. Once symbols are loaded a browser
should open and display the home page. Select **ToDo List** and
execution should halt at the **await LoadMainEntities();** breakpoint in VS.

Azure Portal Web App Diagnostic Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**App Service Diagnostics** as accessed via **Diagnose and Solve
Problems** within the Web App on the Azure Portal.

.. image:: /images/hosting_on_azure/image12.png
   :width: 3.69463in
   :height: 1.19451in

**Diagnostic Tools** has a couple of useful tools, including **Check
Connection String**, access to **Application Event Logs**, and
**Advanced Application Restart**.
