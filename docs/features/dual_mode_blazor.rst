Dual mode Blazor
================

As stated in :doc:`doc home </index>` Blazor has two hosting models: **WebAssembly** or **Server**.
Each hosting model has pros and cons, so you have to decide which is better for your web application.

With Blazor Boilerplate you can switch at runtime between WebAssembly or Server in the Settings of Admin.
